Please stand by as we work to get a new computer and rebuild our website. Thank you.
FINAL CRICKET UPDATE: After much thought and prayer, we’ve decided our best course of action is now just to throw in the towel and take the L on this one. The computer is theirs. They won it fair and square.
We know there is other stuff going on in the world right now, but that doesn't make our personal cricket problem any less important.
Good news and bad news about the crickets. The good news is, Acer has sent us a new computer with all the bells and whistles. The bad news is, it too was infested with crickets.
@thatautguy They love it. They thrive on misery.
@SocrateaseMUSIC we are TRYING. Please see our bio for an official explanation for why we are not publishing anything at the moment.

Okay, we're going to spray the crickets with some Pam to see if that does anything. We'll let you know if it kills them.
@TRollins1138 if birds don't urinate then why are we soaked in bird piss, smart ass?
Worse, we tried to put a bird in the computer to eat the lizard but it wouldn’t fit in the floppy disc slot, so now there are crickets AND a lizard in our computer, AND a bird is flying around our office urinating on everything.
We put a lizard in the computer so it would eat all the crickets, and it did eat a few, but then it somehow vomited up dozens more crickets than it ate, so now there are more crickets than ever before.
UPDATE ON OUR CRICKET SITUATION: Unfortunately it is now way, way worse than before.
